# Analyze A/B Test Results 

## Description

For this project, we are working on understanding the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. A Jupyter Notebook containing various questions and required steps is provided by Udacity. The goal is to work through this notebook and to determine if the company should implement the new page, keep the old page, or perhaps run the experiment longer to make their decision.

The code is written in Python 3, using Pandas and NumPy. The visualizations are created with Matplotlib.
